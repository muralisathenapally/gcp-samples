# Log-Based Alerts in GCP #

## Introduction ##
Log-based alerts in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) allow you to trigger alerts based on log data generated by your Google Cloud resources. These alerts are crucial for monitoring your applications and infrastructure, helping you detect anomalies, errors, and events of interest from the logs.

## How Log-Based Alerts Work ##
Log Generation: Logs are generated by GCP resources such as Compute Engine, Kubernetes, App Engine, and more. These logs are sent to Cloud Logging (formerly Stackdriver Logging).

Log Filters: You create a log-based metric by defining a filter to capture specific log entries. For example, you might filter error logs or logs containing specific keywords.

Alert Policies: Once the log-based metric is created, you can configure an alerting policy. This policy monitors the log-based metric, and when a predefined condition is met (e.g., a certain number of log entries in a given time period), the alert is triggered.

Notification Channels: When the alert condition is met, GCP sends notifications to the configured notification channels, such as email, SMS, Slack, or webhooks.
