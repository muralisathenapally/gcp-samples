What is Cloud Deploy?
	•	Cloud Deploy is a managed CI/CD service in Google Cloud.
	•	It automates delivery of your application to multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
	•	It mainly works with GKE, Cloud Run, and Anthos.
	•	It defines a release pipeline using a YAML config file (delivery pipeline and targets).

What do Cloud Deploy Policies do?
	•	Policies in Cloud Deploy are about security and governance.
	•	They can:
	•	Control who can approve a release to the next environment.
	•	Enforce manual approvals before promotion (e.g., from staging to prod).
	•	Restrict what artifacts (images, manifests) can be deployed based on constraints.

Cloud deploy Policies Not Applicable to Cloud Build Triggers
	•	Cloud Build and Cloud Deploy are separate services:
	•	Cloud Build focuses on building and optionally deploying code via triggers.
	•	Cloud Deploy is focused on managing and controlling deployments across environments.
	Cloud Build:
	•	Doesn’t have the deployment pipeline structure like Cloud Deploy.
	•	Doesn’t support approvals or promotion logic between environments.
	•	Cloud Build triggers are meant to build code, run tests, and optionally deploy.
	•	Cloud Deploy policies are designed to govern deployments, not builds.
	•	The two services have different roles in the CI/CD pipeline.

Cloud deploy manages releases, rollouts and rollbacks to GKE and Cloud Run. while doing these it can enforce approvals and deny actions using policies.
To do this, first a delivery pipeline needs to be created
Delivery pipeline deployes docker images to GKE or Cloudrun. these are called targets. while creating delivery pipeline we can choose the target. and also enforce approval for releases.

Deploy polices can restrict pipeline actions like Create, Advance, Approve, Cancel, Ignore job, Retry job, Roll back and Terminate job run. we must chose on which day to apply this policy. 
this policy can be applied every day or specific days and specific times also. 

For ex: if you want to block releases on weekends, we create a policy and choose saturday and sunday and select the time. now when someone tries to do a release on weekend, they will be denied.

Deploy policy can also be overwritten but the person trying to do so must have clouddeploy.deployPolicies.override permission.
