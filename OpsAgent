1. Ops Agent Setup
Ops Agent sends logs and metrics to cloud logging service. to install the agent run below commands,
curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/add-google-cloud-ops-agent-repo.sh
sudo bash add-google-cloud-ops-agent-repo.sh --also-install
After both of the above commands are succeeded, run below command to check status of the agent
sudo systemctl status google-cloud-ops-agent"*"

2. Application Log Configuration
Ops agent configuration is located at /etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml. Modify it to include application logs. For ex: nessus-scanner, you add below config to the config.yaml under logging receivers section
nessus-scanner_log:
  type: files
  include_paths:
  - /opt/nessus/var/nessus/logs/*
Under service receivers section, add [nessus-scanner_log]

3. Verify data in Cloud Logging
Goto cloud logging service in gcp. Under resource, select vm instance and you should see the log name nessus-scanner_log. Which is the name we gave in the above step. Application Logs should be visible here, if not check the agent config

4. Create log based metric
After the data is visible in logs, create a log based metric from the logs, hereâ€™s an example metric filter,
ADD THE FILTER HERE

5. Check metric data in Prometheus
Once the log metric is created, give it a few hours to get the data populated in prometheus. To check if the metric is visible in prometheus, goto prometheus webpage and search for the metric

6. Create Dashboard in grafana
Goto grafana application using below url
ADD GRAFANA URL HERE
Goto Dashboards and UGCS Critical Systems dashboard, add a graph there.
