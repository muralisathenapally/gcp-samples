READme
======

Identity and Access Management (IAM) deny policies let you set guardrails on access to Google Cloud resources. With deny policies, you can define deny rules that prevent certain principals from using certain permissions, regardless of the roles they're granted.
This code blocks all types of members(users/groups/service accounts) from impersonating service accounts even if they have required IAM roles.

Inputs:

This module expects 2 inputs, 
1. project id on which to create the deny policy
2. name of the deny policy

These deny policies cant be seen from console. One of below commands can list them,

gcloud iam policies list --attachment-point=cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID --kind=denypolicies --format=json

(or) 

gcloud beta iam policies list --attachment-point=cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID --kind=denypolicies --format=json

Added one service account info from given service accounts in code and tried to deploy. However it resulted in error due to options changed/deprecated in the terraform code.

Terraform gcp secret manager secret resource documentation link: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/secret_manager_secret.html

Resolution is to rewrite/upgrade code and then deploy





1. Application is on Compute VM:
  Option1:
  VM has a service account attached to it, grant the service account access to secret that the application needs
  write a bash script that will read the secret and create the json key in a file in the server which can be used by application
  
  Option2:
  VM has a service account attached to it, grant the service account access to secret that the application needs
  Modify application code so that i will get the secret from secret manager and use


2. If the application is running on GKE or CloudRun, we can use option 2
3. Avoid using json key and use the service account attached to VM, GKE, Cloudrun

The main purpose of Checks Guardrails API is to enhance the safety of Generative AI (GenAI) applications by identifying and mitigating potentially harmful content.
It analyzes user inputs and model outputs (text) to detect content that may violate safety policies, such as hate speech, violence, inappropriate language, or discriminatory remarks
It provides a score that indicates the likelihood of a violation, allowing developers to set their own thresholds for blocking or logging content.
Developers can integrate the API to log potential violations or actively block unsafe or inappropriate content from being exposed to users, which is crucial for responsible AI development
